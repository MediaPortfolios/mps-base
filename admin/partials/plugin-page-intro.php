<p><?php _e( 'Although this plugin comes with my business name incorporated into it, I am not trying to put my branding stink all over your project. It has to have a name so I used my own.

<p><?php _e( 'Not every feature included with this plugin will be needed for my projects or yours. And one big reason for writing a site-specific plugin is to include only what the site needs and eliminate the overhead of plugins and themes that offer things that you don\'t need. So why have I packed so much into this plugin? Well, I find it to be much quicker and easier to remove unnecessary code that it is to write, or even copy & paste, new code into a project. And being that you will rename this plugin and that it will update to overwrite your changes, modifications can be made ad libidum.', 'mps-text' ); ?></p>
